          <div class="card__intro">
            <p>Simply Charming is the name of a website selling jewelry with the same brand name - Simply Charming.
              The website sells these goods strictly within Bermuda. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card__text">
            <p>The commercial success of this website was limited to the territory of Bermuda. At the same time, it
              is already a fairly well-known local brand. Before the launch of the website, the company sold its goods
              mainly through a network of tourist kiosks and stores on the islands. After the launch of the website,
              many locals were able to see the full list of the items available, and now easily purchase them
              online.</p>

            Main Challenges
          </h3>
          <div class="card__text">
            <ul class="list_marker_dot list_color_dark">
              <li>

                client to remain as independent as possible after the project has been completed.</span>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The main feature of this project was that the client was limited by the budget, but at the same time
              they wanted to get a high-quality result based on a strong platform with a large set of basic
              functionality. In order to implement all the desired functional elements to the website we integrated
              ready-made solutions in the form of tested paid modules, which allowed us to significantly reduce the
              time and budget of the project. And we used Meticulosity Facepayment - a payment system that was
              difficult to test. </p>

            <p>We set a goal to find a flexible system for a jewelry eStore, give clients a possibility of further

            <p>We helped develop a product that created a new sales channel for the client based on a modern and

              products.

          <p>We have wanted to launch an online store to sell our jewelry for a long time, to give both locals in
            Bermuda and the many tourists the opportunity to purchase our products online. We didn’t know what platform
            would be best to use to build such a website. Our goal was to have a flexible system, the possibility of
            further support, wide visibility, not to be dependent on just one contractor, and wide functionality.
            The Scaleox team suggested creating a website on Magento. Having heard about the benefits of this platform
            and the company's rich experience in implementing online stores on Magento - we decided to rely on
            Scaleox's expertise. As a result, we have a fully ready website in a relatively short period of time,
            which allows us to work with a wide range of functionalities and present our products to our customers
            all over the world.
