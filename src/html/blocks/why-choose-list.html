      To ensure you do not waste your budget on reworking defects after the software development cycle (SDLC) has already started, we will carry out requirements specification, prototyping and user testing at the initial stage of the development. What is more, we perform Design Prints to reduce the risk of possible shortcomings, and create a product roadmap before the development process takes place.
